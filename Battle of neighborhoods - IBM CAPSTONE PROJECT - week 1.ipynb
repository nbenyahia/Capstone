In our case I will suggest London, then we will need the data about boroughs and neighborhood in London. So we will need all the postcodes, latitudes and longitudes of all boroughs and neighborhood of London. This kind of data could be find in differents websites but the one we will be using is \"www.doogal.co.uk\" where we could find a csv file of 657 boroughs and neighborhood in London.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After importing all these data, we will need to clean it and provide a dataframe of boroughs neighborhoods, latitudes and longitudes. Then this dataframe will help us to get all the venues in these boroughs and neighborhood using the Foursquare api and then it should be cleaned and use all the information we have about these venues (mostly the venues categories) to get you the best Indian Restaurant in London and to find all similar venues where we can open an Indian Restaurant there."
