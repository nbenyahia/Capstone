    "In this project, the problem attempted to solve will be to find the best possible location or the most optimal, for an Indian restaurant in the city of London, United Kingdom. To achieve this task, an analytical approach will be used, based on advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis, concretely clustering and perhaps some data visualization techniques.\n",

    "During the process of analysis, several data transformations will be performed, in order the find the best possible data format for the machine learning model to ingest. Once the data is set up and prepared, a modeling process will be carried out, and this statistical analysis will provide the best possible places to locate the Indian restaurant.\n",

    "The idea is to focus on the venues where I can find some good Indian Restaurant in terms of Rating ( a good restaurant for me will have a rating greater or equal to 9.0/10.0) and then look for similar venues where we cannot find a similar restaurants in terms of rating and where we can avoid competition."

This way, it is possible to have a taste of how the city's venues are distributed, what are the most common places for leisure, and in general, it will provide an idea of what people's likes are.\n",

    "2. The www.doogal.co.uk Website: This site provides several data sources of great utility to solve this problem. The files are provided in csv format, and they are built over a statstical exploitation and use basis. The data contains updated information about the postcodes and locations of Boroughs and neighborhoods in London. This data will be analyzed in such a way that one could determine the best location of r anew venue/restaurant/other based on similarities between neighborhoods and the rating of differents restaurants."

    "This approach is similar to K-Means by choosing the very high number of clusters and then choose the elements that are in the clusters of top Indian restaurants. But this one is more effective because we don't create some clusters we don't need. Another point is our method is very fast because we need to calculate the euclidean distance and get the 3 smallest values.  <br> <br>\n",
    "Our approach is not the best for this kind of problem but it still can be used in reality. We can improved more by adding some important features to our data. For example we can look for the population in each borough or neighborhood, or we can look for the number people interested in these kind of venues or restaurants (i.e. Indian people living in these regions).<br> <br>\n",

    "Another critics we are expecting are the results doesn't give the best choice for the investors but just suggestions of some good locations. This is true, but we all know the accuracy of these type of algorithm is not very high and the investors should proceed to other types of analysis (Budget, groceries nearby ...) to decide which one the suggestions is the best for them."
